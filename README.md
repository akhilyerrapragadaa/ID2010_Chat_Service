The requirement is to implement Away From Keyboard(AFK) and user status.

1) An AFK (Away From Keyboard) detector that automatically notifies the other clients when someone has been inactive for a certain period of time. The message should be automatically generated when the timeout period expires. 
Add a command in the client for turning on and off the display of such automated messages.

2) Enable all clients connected to the service to see whenever a client joins or leaves the chat. Add a user command to the client that allows the user to list users currently joined to the service. If the client uses the .name command, this should be seen by all connected clients.
